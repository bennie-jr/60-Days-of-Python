### DAY 11 - APP1: Build a To-do App with Python(Using Custom Functions)

Today, I worked on avoiding code repetition by introducing functions in the code base.

Recap on yesterday's code. With the todo app from yesterday, I fixed two bugs in the code. 
I also added error handling (Try-Except) to the edit and complete option blocks to handle invalid 
inputs by keeping the code running and not breaking to improve user experience. Today, I introduced 
functions into the code base. I wrote a function to read from the text file that acts as the central storage 
for the todos and return them to be worked on by the conditional blocks. I basically took  out the open builtin 
function that reads the todos text file which was repeated severally in the code, wrote one function for it and 
called the function at the needed points in the code.

I also experimented more on function definitions, function calls and the return keyword.

In today's bonus section I wrote a function that reads a bunch of temperatures from a text file and then calculates the average of the temperatures.

I did an exercise on bug fixing.

Lastly, I learned about the differences between python and other programming languages 

All in all, day 11 was good, I learned something new. I will keep building on the to-do app making it more robust in the coming days.
