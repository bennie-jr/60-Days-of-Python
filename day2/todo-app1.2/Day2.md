### DAY 2 - APP1: Build a To-do App with Python(Methods and While-Loop)

Today's exercise was more of a refresher on python methods and statements i.e while-loops only.

Building on yesterday's code. With the todo app from yesterday I had to manually input every single to-do user input but today I built on it by automating the number of times a user had to input a todo with while loops and a boolean.
I also used the .append() method to keep storing the user input in a list. I was also introduced to other methods like .capitalize() and .title().
I was able to figure out that the major difference between a method and a function is even though they look similar methods are always attached to a data type.

There was also a bonus example where I had to implement while-loops and comparison operators to build a simple password checker.

I did a few more exercises on bug fixing.

Lastly, I learnt about the python console and how to use it to figure out which methods go with which data type. 
That is using "dir(datatype)" to get all the methods associated with that particular data type and "help(datatype.method)" to give you more information on how to use that particular method.

Overall today was okay and not bad for a second day. I will keep building on the to-do app making it more robust in the coming days.
