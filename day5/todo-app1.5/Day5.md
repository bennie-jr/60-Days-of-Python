### DAY 5 - APP1: Build a To-do App with Python(Enumerate and f-strings)

Today's focus was on python's enumerate function and f-strings only.

Recap on yesterday's code. With the todo app from yesterday, I worked on making the program a bit more intelligent than before. I added a fourth choice which was Edit which asked the user
to edit and replace the todo the user wanted to edit. Today I worked on making the program a bit more intelligent and improved user experience. I improved the show option(case show block) by adding the enumerate function
and f-strings to the for loop which numbered the todos and made the printed out todos look more human-readable. Also added a fifth choice which was "complete".
The complete case block basically helped the user to pick out a todo which has been completed to be removed from the list. This was done using the .pop() method with indexing.
Again I had to take into consideration human counting and make it fit into the program.

I also experimented with for loops and how different indentation points affect your code. Also experimented with the enumerate function. 

In today's bonus section I had to solve a python exercise with the .sort() method, the enumerate function and f-strings.

I did a few more exercises on bug fixing.

Lastly, I learned about how to ask good programming questions on stack overflow and google and how to properly structure your questions.


Overall, the fifth day was good for me, I learned something new. I will keep building on the to-do app making it more robust in the coming days.
