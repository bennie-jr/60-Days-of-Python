# 60-Days-of-Python

This repository is purposely for me to improve my skills as a programmer by building 20 diverse applications, ranging from simple scripts to complex web apps in a 60 day period. Each project is crafted to teach me essential programming concepts, best practices, and the problem-solving techniques required in a professional environment.

At the end of this journey I expect to move from my curent skills to a proficient Python programmer capable of building real-world applications.
