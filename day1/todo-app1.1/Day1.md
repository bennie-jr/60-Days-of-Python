### DAY 1- APP1: Build a To-do App with Python(Variables, Lists, and Print)

Today's exercise was more of refresher on python objects and data types I already know which are variables, strings and lists.

I built a simple to-do app which was more like a user prompt to input your to-do list(strings). I made use of the input function and print function mostly throughout out the code.

There was also a bonus example where i had to implement the len function to get the length of a string.

I was also introduced to the concept of bug fixing and I did a few exercises on bug fixing.

Overall today has been a good refresher and a good start for a first day. I will keep building on the to-do app making it more robust in the coming days.
