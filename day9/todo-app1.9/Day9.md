### DAY 9 - APP1: Build a To-do App with Python(If-Elif-Else and Dictionaries)

Today, I worked on optimising and improving the code with if-elif-else conditionals.

Recap on yesterday's code. With the todo app from yesterday, I optimised the code with the with-context manager. Today, I worked with conditionals. Up until yesterday,
I have been using the match-case statement but this statement is limited and was in one way or the other going to fail me. The match-case statement is very limited and can
only check if one value is equal to another. You cannot enter an expression after case and since I wanted to improve user experience and optimise the code by removing the multiple
input methods there was a need to replace the match case block with if-elif-else conditionals. I was aiming to take out the multiple user input methods in the code and allow
the user to just add whatever it is they wanted to do straight to the options available. For example, if a user wants to add a todo , when the user is prompted, the user can type
"add play football" instead of typing add on the first prompt and typing the todo on the follow-up prompt. This what I did throughout the code taking out match-case and replacing it
with if-else-conditionals. I also used list slicing method to only append the changes the user wanted to make to the list and exclude the option since it was all bundled up in
one string.

I also experimented more on the if-elif-else conditionals and python dictionaries as well.

In today's bonus section I wrote a program that checks the strength of a password against a set of requirements(8 characters, 1 number and 1 uppercase letter). I made use of for-loops, 
conditionals, dictionaries and a few new methods i.e. isdigit() and isupper()

I did a few exercises on bug fixing.

Lastly, I learned about High and Low Level programming languages and assembly language, what they are and the differences between them. 

Overall, day 9 was quite good, I learned something new. I will keep building on the to-do app making it more robust in the coming days.
