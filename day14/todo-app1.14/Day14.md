### DAY 14 - APP1: Build a To-do App with Python(Using Local Modules)

Today, I continued with avoiding code repetition by using functions and introduced local modules.

Recap on yesterday's code. With the todo app from yesterday, I introduced default arguments in the code base
so I wouldn't have to keep adding the text file as an argument everytime I call the function. I also added to the 
code docstrings to briefly describe what the functions did. Today, I introduced local modules. I placed the functions
in a separate file and called the functions in the main.py file. I tried the various ways you can import functions(which is 2 btw) 
in different files into the main python file. 

I also experimented more on modules and how you can prevent executing some lines when you import.

In today's bonus section I built on the function I wrote previously which converts feet inches to meters and calls the 
function in an if else condition to check the height of kids at a theme park. I moved the convert and parse functions to
new files and called those function and the main file.

I did a few exercises on bug fixing.

Lastly, I refreshed my memory on version control systems and git.

All in all, day 14 was okay, I learned something new. I will keep building on the to-do app making it more robust in the coming days.
