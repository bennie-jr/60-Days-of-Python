### DAY 12 - APP1: Build a To-do App with Python(Multiple Functional Arguments)

Today, I continued with avoiding code repetition by using functions and introduced multiple arguments.

Recap on yesterday's code. With the todo app from yesterday, I wrote a function to read from the text file 
for the todos and return them to be worked on by the conditional blocks. I took out the several open builtin 
functions and wrote one function for it. Today I continued from where I left off with functions, the 
function I wrote yesterday was for reading from the text file. I added another function to write to the text file
hereby eliminating the need to have various open builtin functions for writing to the text file in the code base.
I also introduced multiple  arguments for the write todos function which included the filepath and the todos list
that would be written to the file. I called the write function at all the points I wrote the open builtin function earlier
to write to file and the code worked without a hitch.

I also experimented more on functions.

In today's bonus section I wrote a function which converts feet inches to meters and called the function in an if else condition
to check the height of kids at a theme park. This program introduced me to a new concept call decoupling in programming.

I did a couple of exercises on bug fixing.

Lastly, I learned about the learn-to-program curve of beginners in programming. I realized that its not a linear path to proficiency
there are ups and downs.

All in all, day 12 was good, I learned something new. I will keep building on the to-do app making it more robust in the coming days.
