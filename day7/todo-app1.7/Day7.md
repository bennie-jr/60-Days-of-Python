### DAY 7 - APP1: Build a To-do App with Python(List Comprehension and Comments)

Today, I worked with list comprehension in python.

Recap on yesterday's code. With the todo app from yesterday, I worked with only text files. I created a text file to store the todos and adjusted the code accordingly. I also tweaked the user input code line to give more readability to the todo list.
Today I did not do much, I worked on making the program output a bit user-friendly with list comprehension. The previous code had an unusually bigger spacing and this is because of the line break or backslash characters I added to user input and the for
loop adding some more as well. To fix this, I used a list comprehension which included the .strip('\n') method and this  method stripped off the extra line break making the output more user-friendly. 

I also experimented more on list comprehension and comments. With comments, I learnt about when and how to use them in your code.

In today's bonus section I worked on using list comprehension to replace certain characters in the list with other characters with the replace() method then, concatenating with another string(in my case adding a file extension to the string).

I did a few more exercises on bug fixing.

Lastly, I learned about the usage of python in real life as in the various branches in the tech industry python thrives eg machine learning, data science,web development etc.


Overall, day 7 was quite okay, I learned something new. I will keep building on the to-do app making it more robust in the coming days.
