### DAY 3 - APP1: Build a To-do App with Python(Match-Case and For-Loops)

Today's exercise was more focused on python match-case and the for-loops statement only.

Recap on yesterday's code. With the todo app from yesterday I automated the user input to keep repeating an infinite number of times and store and print out user inputs appended to a list.
Today, I built on the previous code by making the code a little more intelligent than before. I gave the user 3 choices (add, show and exit) with each choice having a separate thing it does by making use of  match-case.
Add will keep adding and appending to the todo list, show will print out the todos you currently have and exit will break out of the loop and stop the running code.

I also experimented with the code by adding "case _:" case with a placeholder (python best practice apparently) with a conditional which runs if a user does not input any of the 3 choices provided.
Also added more lines to the For-loop to capitalize the todos with the ".title()" method.

There was also a bonus where I had to implement for-loops in various examples.

I did a few more exercises on bug fixing.

Lastly, I learnt about python itself. The general idea and what goes on under the hood between me(user), the interpreter and the computer processor. 


Overall today was good for a third day, I learned something new. I will keep building on the to-do app making it more robust in the coming days.
